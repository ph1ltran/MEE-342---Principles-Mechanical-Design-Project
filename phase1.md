## Executive Summary:
An iPad stand is a common yet versatile accessory designed to hold an iPad (or other geometrically-similar device) in an adjustable, hands-free position that offers an optimal viewing angle to the user. It is typically found in home or office settings and is used for everyday applications such as studying, video conferencing, media consumption, and gaming while providing the benefits of improved ergonomics, increased comfort, reduced neck and eye strain, reduced wrist fatigue, and increased device stability.

This project, assigned as part of the MEE 342: Principles Mechanical Design course at Arizona State University, will involve the reverse-engineering (studying, modelling, documenting, 3D printing, and prototyping) of an iPad stand. Several key factors will need to be considered with regards to the functionality and feasibility of this mechanical system. For example, the iPad Stand is expected to remain balanced on a level surface while it is subjected to its intended load, which can have different directions depending on how the holder is positioned. The iPad stand will be capable of rotating to multiple viewing angles, resulting in changing load paths and boundary conditions that increase the importance of proper stress-strain analysis. In addition, finite element analysis (FEA) will need to be performed on the system to ensure that it will not experience excessive stress or deformation that would cause structural failure. Other design fundamentals and skills, including but not limited to material selection, failure modes, and computer-aided design (CAD), will also be applied to the design process of the iPad Stand. 

## System Description & Functional Overview:
The iPad stand should be assembled from three main components: an angled support, a lipped-device holder, and a tightening bolt connecting the support to the holder. The angled support should be able to balance the entire assembly on a level surface for any adjustment of the holder, regardless of it being subjected to a load from the weight of the device. To equate this, the center of mass as well as tipping moments will need to be calculated. This means that even if a device has not been placed on the stand, it should still be able to support itself and not tip in any direction, which can be accomplished by adding a heavy weight to the bottom of the support. The lipped-device holder should be able to support the weight of the device that is placed upon it while not tilting itself. To be considered functional, its position can only be adjusted when an external load (not the device weight) is applied by the user. The third and final key component within the system is the tightening bolt that secures the support to the holder. The tightening bolt should be fastened to a screw hole in between the support and the holder, but should allow the user to position the angle as desired.
